=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Handle::Mock - Helper for testing L<AnyEvent::Handle>-based code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::Handle::Mock;

    my $mock = AnyEvent::Handle::Mock->new;

    # This code is usually in the module you want to test
    # Here is a 'reverse line' server
    my $h = AnyEvent::Handle->new(
	fh => $mock->fh,
	on_read => sub {
	    $_[0]->push_read(line => sub {
		my ($h, $line) = @_;
		$h->push_write(reverse($line)."\n");
	    });
	});

    # Tests
    use Test::More tests => 1;
    $mock->feed("Hello, world!\n");
    ok($mock->pump('line'), '!dlrow , olleH');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a filehandle that you can give to the L<AnyEvent::Handle>
constructor and methods to feed and pump from the handle.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new>

Constructor. No arguments.

=item C<fh>

Returns the file handle to give to the L<AnyEvent::Handle> constructor.

=item C<feed>

Send data. Arguments are the same as C<AnyEvent::Handle-E<gt>push_read>.

=item C<pump>

Wait for data, synchronously: the event loop will run due to C<-E<gt>recv> on
a condvar.

Arguments are the same as C<AnyEvent::Handle-E<gt>push_write> (which means you
can use any C<anyevent_read_type>), except the callback is optional. If it is
missing, the received data will be the return value of the method.
